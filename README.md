#John Snow's 1854 Cholera Map

recreated in D3.js

First stab at the data and inspiration from [rtwilson](http://blog.rtwilson.com/john-snows-cholera-data-in-more-formats/).  I found a hi-res map and [extended dataset here](https://www.udel.edu/johnmack/frec682/cholera/index.html), and used [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/) to add some points that were not in rtwilson's original set.

read about the significance of the [original map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak)


drawn using d3.js with a lot of help from [let's make a map](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) and [vector tiles](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5798874)

open street map tiles from [Mapnik Vector Tiles](http://openstreetmap.us/~migurski/vector-datasource/)
